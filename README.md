Library-System
==============

Simple library booking system created for a project in college. 

The system is written in pure C, and makes use of saving to bin files to store the library data.

The system was meant to allow addition and removal of books to the system, and also implement two search methods, one using an ISBN number of a book and another using partial string searching on the book's title and author.
